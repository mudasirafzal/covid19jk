# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ˜„

Contributions are handled in the form of Pull Requests. You fork this repository, create a new branch, make relevant changes, and submit a Pull Request â€“ once that's done we'll be able to review your PRs and merge them to the master branch.

Always submit a PR against a "Claimed Issue" that's been assigned to you. If an issue doesn't exist, please raise one first and wait for it to be labelled as "Available", and then have it assigned to you. PRs without having accepted issues mentioned will be closed.
